# No Frameworks

Exploring how to build common web elements without the help of frameworks or dependencies.

The web is often cluttered with a million packages and frameworks to accomplish common web elements we use everyday. I meet many web developers who download entire bloated frameworks to add basic elements to their pages like tabs or menus.

It doesn't have to be this way! We can build many of these elements really simply using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We don't need the help of frameworks.

Throughout this series we will explore how to build common web elements without any dependencies or frameworks. Just the basic web tools that everyone has access to.

## Elements

This list will be updated as this project grows. Each element has an accompanying video on YouTube that you can watch to learn more about how it is built.

### Accordion Menus

You will find accordion's commonly on help pages and as FAQs. They work well because they condense information to be hidden when not needed, and expand to display the information in an elegant manner.
